					<p> Developers from all over the world daily build their work guided by the Scrum methodology, there are real
						keepers of the methodology - the Scrum masters</p>
				</section>
				<section>But why?
					<p> And what is it?</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>Scrum is just a technique. A work organization system that helps not to miss the main thing, achieve
				goals and take into account mistakes for future achievements.
				<p>That's all. So simple.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<section><p>
				But ... This system helps to organize a complex and multi-level world of tasks. As if you have a simple and easy way before you </section>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			So lets investigate how we can use SCRUM in our every day life

			<section>Stand-ups</section>
			<section>Scrum Master</section>
			<section>Retrospective</section>
			<section>Board. Graphical representation</section>
			<section>Backlogs</section>
			<section>It's just a part </section>
		</section>

			<section>Everything is under control, so you don't have to think about the little things, what to do when to start, on the one hand there is no choice and this is good, you move strictly along the board according to priorities, on the other hand, if there is room for maneuver, you can easily pick up a suitable task from the backlog.</section>
			<section>So SCRUM is the way to organize development or everyday life</section>
			<section>Scrum master you are your personal scrum master â€“ you know better of other how you can work not hardly but more effectively, and be more happy. May be. </section>

			<section>Thank you for your attention</section>
