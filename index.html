					<p> Developers from all over the world daily build their work guided by the Scrum methodology, there are real
						keepers of the methodology - the Scrum masters</p>
				</section>
				<section>But why?
					<p> And what is it?</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>Scrum is just a technique. A work organization system that helps not to miss the main thing, achieve
				goals and take into account mistakes for future achievements.
				<p>That's all. So simple.</p>

						But... This system helps to organize a complex and multi-level world of tasks...
				</section>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>As if you have a simple and easy way before you! </p>

			<section>
				So lets investigate how we can use SCRUM in our every day life

				<section>Components</section>
				<section id="fit-text">Sprints</section>
				<section>
					<p>A sprint is a short time frame during which a scrum team does a given amount of work. &#169; Atlassian</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Have you really achieved your goals?) </p>
					<img src="examples/assets/sprint.png" width='60%' height='60%'>
				</section>
				<section>Stand-ups</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						It is commonly called the daily scrum meeting.
						The content of this meeting depends on the team.
					</p>
					<p>Good example is meeting agenda at Atlassian company</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>"What did I manage to do yesterday?"</li>
						<li>"What will I be working on today?"</li>
						<li>"What problems are holding me back from moving forward?"</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>Board. Graphical representation</section>
				<section>
					Graphic representation is one of the important components of the SCRUM methodology.

					</section>
				<section>Backlogs</section>
				<section>Scrum Master</section>
				<section>It's just a part </section>
			</section>

			<section>Everything is under control, so you don't have to think about the little things, what to do when to
				start, on the one hand there is no choice and this is good, you move strictly along the board according to
				priorities, on the other hand, if there is room for maneuver, you can easily pick up a suitable task from the
				backlog.</section>
			<section>So SCRUM is the way to organize development or everyday life</section>
			<section>Scrum master you are your personal scrum master â€“ you know better of other how you can work not hardly
				but more effectively, and be more happy. May be. </section>

			<section>Thank you for your attention</section>
